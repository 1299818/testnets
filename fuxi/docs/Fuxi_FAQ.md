# Fuxi Incentivized Testnet FAQ


1. How can I participate in Fuxi testnet?
You should join the Riot Room: https://matrix.to/#/!bmimZgJrUWSmxqQEmG:matrix.org, the team will have announcement about the news of testnet. 
There are two ways for join:
* Join as a validator:

You could run your IRIShub on your own server. Then you could bond to be a validator node. If you have trouble setting up your own server,
you could sign up for free trial of the BaaS service from Wancloud or Zig-BaaS. Then you could complete all the tasks. 

Join as a delegator:

You don't have to run a validator node to join the testnet. You could simply download a client binary and send transactions. 

2. How to find the tasks?
For each iteration of testnet, the team will publish some tasks at GitHub repo. For example, you could read about Fuxi-3001 tasks here:
https://github.com/irisnet/testnets/tree/master/fuxi/fuxi-3001

3. How to see my scores?
When the testnet is closed, the team will check the proof of tasks and publish the results on GitHub. For example, you could read about the reward distribution for Fuxi-2000 here: https://github.com/irisnet/testnets/issues/51

4. When could I receive my rewards?
The rewards will be sent to your account once IRIShub mainnet is live. The way to claim your reward is to sign your IRIShub address with your Keybase account and send it to the team.
