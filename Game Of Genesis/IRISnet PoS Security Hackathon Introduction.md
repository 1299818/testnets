## IRISnet PoS Security Hackathon

### Instruction

The IRIS network will keep generating value when its validators could keep the whole network secure. Hackathons are built for rapid innovation. IRIS&Dorahacks believes hackathons will generate the most impressive solutions for protecting a Proof-of-Stake blockchain.

### Purpose:

- Raise awareness of IRISnet from crypto community
- Provide a solid path for users to learn PoS mechanism, including the concepts of validator and delegator
- Train validator competency at incident response, network hardening, responding liveness failures.

### Schedule:

1. **Online workshop**

- Date: 2018–8–25
- Subject: Proof-of-Stake Security Model
- Speaker: Suyu, Blockchain Researcher of Bianjie.AI

**2. Online AMA**

- Date:2018–8–27
- Speaker: all the nentors
- PoS Security Hackathon

**2. PoS Security Hackathon**

Date: 2018.9.3~2018.9.23

- Phase 1：2018.9.3~2018.9.9

Build a validator node.

- Phase 2：2018.9.10~2018.9.16

Participants could be attacked and also they need to fulfill some tasks.

- Phase 3：2018.9.17~2018.9.23

Allow hackers to attack each other.

### **Who should join：**

Hackers around the world who are interested in IRISnet. 

#### Scope:

Everyone is welcomed

### Prizes：

Iris tokens in bounty pool are totally worth $17K. It is designed to be distributed in the following way:

- **First Prize：$2000/person, 3 teams**
- **Second Prize: $1000/person, 5 teams**
- **Third Prize: $500/person, 10 teams**
- **Participation Prize: $10/person, 100 teams**

The final winners will be rewarded iris tokens equivalent of dollars they deserves, with the exchange rate 1 IRIS = $0.08.

### Hackathon Rules

**Team：**

3–6 people 

**How to participate：**

- Form team freely
- Participate in Workshop, get knowledge about concepts related to IRISnet and how to build a validator
- Receive tokens and complete node placement on the server
- Before the game beginning officially, guarantee to be online through security testing

If the validator is misconfigured or under attacked, it will be offline. In a PoS network, if a validator went offline, a portion of the staked tokens will be slashed. The system will record the numbers of slahing and how well they committed to the consensus. At genesis, all the account balance of hackers is 1000 iris. Their balance will change according to their performance. 

#### Judging Principle:

- The online time is enough;
- Finish some tasks.

#### Judging Indicators:

- The voting power of validator node
- How many tasks are finished

In the end, all hackers are ranked according to the scores from low to high.

**Who would like to win:**

- Familiar with the Tendermint consensus
- Familiar with Cosmos-SDK codebase
- Familiar with IRIShub codebase
- Familiar with blockchain network security
